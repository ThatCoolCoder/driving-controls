Components:
- arduino uno
- quadrature rotary encoder (360ppr works well)

Connections:
- rotary encoder power/gnd to arduino
- 1st rotary encoder signal wire (possibly called clk) to pin 2
- 2nd rotary encoder signal wire (possibly called dt) to pin 3
- buttons can be wired between pin 4/5/6 etc and ground, then the button config arrays in the arduino file should be modified to match this
