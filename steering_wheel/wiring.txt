Components:
- arduino uno
- quadrature rotary encoder (20ppr)
- switch that goes LOW when wheel is at an integer number of revolutions

Connections:
- rotary encoder power/gnd to arduino
- 1st rotary encoder signal wire (possibly called clk) to pin 2
- 2nd rotary encoder signal wire (possibly called dt) to pin 3
- switch to ground and pin 5
